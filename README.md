An investigation of Clery Act Campus Crimes reports between 2008-2021

The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, formerly known as the Campus Security Act, is a federal law that requires colleges and universities across the United States to disclose information about crime on and around their campuses. All public and private institutions of postsecondary education participating in federal student aid programs are subject to it.

The San Diego Police Department receives requests for this information from institutions of higher learning regularly. To better accommodate their requests, standard reports have been produced to provide the necessary information. The information in these reports is broken down by census tract.

To find out which census tract an address lies within, you can view Census 2010 tract boundaries (for data beginning with 2013) and Census 2000 tract boundaries (for data prior to 2013) on SANDAG' interactive mapping web page.

Information for a more precisely defined area around a campus can be obtained for a fee from the Automated Regional Justice Information System (ARJIS).  Contact webmaster@arjis.org for further information.
